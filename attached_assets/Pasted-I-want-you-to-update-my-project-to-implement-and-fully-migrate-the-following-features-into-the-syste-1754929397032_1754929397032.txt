I want you to update my project to implement and fully migrate the following features into the system:

1. **Split client registration into two steps**:

   **Step 1 – Basic company info**:
   - Fields: `company_name`, `org_number`.
   - When org number is entered, automatically fetch from Brønnøysundregisteret (using the existing API integration) and pre-fill:
     - Company name
     - Address
     - Postcode
     - City
     - Municipality
     - Phone
     - Email
   - Allow manual editing if needed.
   - "Next" button goes to Step 2.

   **Step 2 – Engagement & settings**:
   - Show AML/KYC status (dropdown: Pending, Approved, Rejected).
   - Multi-select checklist of tasks to perform (default: Bokføring, MVA, Lønn, Bankavstemming, Kontoavstemming + free-text).
   - Dropdown to choose accounting system (Fiken, Tripletex, Unimicro, PowerOffice, Conta, Other).
   - Dropdown or search to choose `responsible_person_id` from employees list.
   - Ability to attach Regnskap Norge checklists (multi-select or file upload).
   - "Save Client" button stores all data.

2. **Client details view**:
   - Show all information from both steps:
     - Company info
     - AML/KYC status
     - Tasks
     - Accounting system
     - Responsible person
     - Attached checklists

3. **Employee management**:
   - New "Employees" page for admins to register employees who can be responsible for clients.
   - Employee fields: `name`, `title`, `email`.
   - These employees appear in "Responsible Person" dropdown in Step 2.

4. **Database migration**:
   - Update `clients` table with new fields:
     - `company_name` (TEXT)
     - `org_number` (TEXT)
     - `address` (TEXT)
     - `postcode` (TEXT)
     - `city` (TEXT)
     - `municipality` (TEXT)
     - `phone` (TEXT)
     - `email` (TEXT)
     - `kyc_status` (TEXT)
     - `tasks` (JSONB)
     - `accounting_system` (TEXT)
     - `responsible_person_id` (UUID)
     - `checklists` (JSONB)
   - Create new `employees` table:
     - `id` (UUID, PK)
     - `name` (TEXT)
     - `title` (TEXT)
     - `email` (TEXT)

5. **Automatic migration**:
   - Generate and apply database migrations for the above changes using our ORM/migration system.
   - Ensure all existing data is preserved.
   - Update backend API routes to support the new fields.
   - Update frontend forms and views to use the new fields.

6. **Navigation**:
   - Add "Employees" link in admin menu.
   - Ensure client list shows company name and responsible person.

7. **Testing**:
   - Step 1 correctly fetches Brønnøysund data.
   - Step 2 saves engagement settings.
   - Client detail view displays all information.
   - Employees can be added and selected as responsible person.

Do not remove any existing features — only add and migrate as described.
