Performance
A 'cache-control' header is missing or empty.
'visibility' changes to this property will trigger: 'Layout', which can impact performance when used inside @keyframes.
A 'cache-control' header contains directives which are not recommended: 'no-store'
Security
A 'set-cookie' header doesn't have the 'secure' directive.
Response should include 'x-content-type-options' header.
A 'set-cookie' header doesn't have the 'httponly' directive.
Response should not include disallowed headers: x-powered-by
The 'X-Frame-Options' header should not be used. A similar effect, with more consistent support and stronger checks, can be achieved with the 'Content-Security-Policy' header and 'frame-ancestors' directive.
Other
A form field element should have an id or name attribute
A form field element has neither an id nor a name attribute. This might prevent the browser from correctly autofilling the form.

To fix this issue, add a unique id or name attribute to a form field. This is not strictly needed, but still recommended even if you have an autocomplete attribute on the same element.
