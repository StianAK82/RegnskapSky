I want you to update my project with the following requirements:

1. **Fix the "accounting_system does not exist" error**:
   - Create a database migration for the `clients` table that adds the following columns:
     - `accounting_system` (TEXT)
     - `kyc_status` (TEXT)
     - `aml_documents` (JSONB)
     - `tasks` (JSONB)
     - `responsible_person_id` (UUID)
     - `recurring_tasks` (JSONB)
     - `hourly_report_notes` (TEXT)
     - `checklist_status` (TEXT)

2. **Update the shared schema** (`shared/schema.ts`) to include these new fields in the `clients` definition so backend and frontend can use them.

3. **Update the "New Client" form in frontend**:
   - Add dropdown for `accounting_system` with options: `Fiken`, `Tripletex`, `Unimicro`, `PowerOffice`, `Conta`, `Other`.
   - Add dropdown for `kyc_status` with options: `Pending`, `Approved`, `Rejected`.
   - Add file upload for `aml_documents`.
   - Add multi-select or checklist for `tasks` with predefined options: `Bokføring`, `MVA`, `Lønn`, `Bankavstemming`, `Kontoavstemming` + free-text option.
   - Add dropdown or search to select `responsible_person_id` from employees.
   - Add a repeater field for `recurring_tasks` with task name + frequency + due date.
   - Add text area for `hourly_report_notes`.
   - Add dropdown for `checklist_status` with options: `Not Started`, `In Progress`, `Completed`.

4. **When a user selects an accounting system**, redirect them to the correct external login/setup page:
   - `Fiken`: `https://fiken.no`
   - `Tripletex`: `https://tripletex.no`
   - `Unimicro`: `https://unimicro.no`
   - `PowerOffice`: `https://poweroffice.no`
   - `Conta`: `https://conta.no`

5. **Integrate Brønnøysund API**:
   - When a user enters an organization number in the "New Client" form, automatically fetch and fill out:
     - Company name
     - Address
     - Postcode
     - City
     - Municipality
     - NACE industry code
   - Use the `openapi.json` file I have already uploaded for API structure.
   - Show an error if the org number is invalid.

6. **Activate AI Assistant**:
   - Make sure the AI Assistant page is functional and connected to my backend.
   - AI should be able to answer accounting-related questions and analyze documents.

7. **User role handling**:
   - Add role-based dashboard:
     - **Admin**: Can see all employees, number of tasks per employee, reassign tasks, see total time per client.
     - **Employee**: Can see only their own tasks and time reports.

8. **Fix any broken integration buttons** in the Integrations page so they open their respective setup modals or redirect links.

After making all these changes:
- Run the migration so the database schema is updated.
- Test that creating a new client works without errors.
- Test Brønnøysund data fetching.
- Test AI Assistant functionality.
- Test role-based dashboard features.

Make sure no existing functionality is removed — only add and fix as described.
