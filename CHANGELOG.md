# CHANGELOG

## [Audit Implementation] - 2025-01-25

### Added (Testing & CI Infrastructure)
- **Test Suite Infrastructure**
  - `tests/api/` - API contract tests with Jest + Supertest
  - `tests/e2e/` - End-to-end tests with Playwright
  - `tests/jest.config.js` - Jest configuration for API tests
  - `tests/setup.ts` - Test environment setup and mocks
  - `playwright.config.ts` - Playwright configuration for E2E tests

- **Database Seeding**
  - `scripts/seed.ts` - Complete database seeder with test data
  - Creates 2 tenants, 4 users, 2 employees, 2 clients, 3 tasks, 4 time entries
  - Provides test credentials for all user types

- **CI/CD Pipeline**
  - `.github/workflows/test.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow
  - Runs API tests and E2E tests with PostgreSQL service
  - Includes test result artifacts and coverage reporting

- **Audit Documentation**
  - `scripts/audit/report.md` - Comprehensive audit report against specification
  - `scripts/audit/report.json` - Machine-readable audit results
  - `scripts/audit/missing_migrations.sql` - SQL for missing database columns

### Test Coverage Added
- **API Tests** (tests/api/):
  - Authentication endpoints (login, password reset - skipped for missing implementation)
  - Admin endpoints (companies management - skipped for missing implementation)
  - Role-based access control verification

- **E2E Tests** (tests/e2e/):
  - Dashboard navigation and metrics display
  - Client management workflow
  - KYC/AML status display (partial)
  - Missing features marked with `.skip()` for future implementation

### Database Schema Analysis
- **Existing Tables Verified**: users, tenants, clients, tasks, time_entries, employees
- **Missing Tables Identified**: password_reset_tokens, audit_logs, kyc_cases, aml_screenings
- **Missing Columns Identified**: 
  - clients: Altinn-related fields (altinn_access, altinn_access_type, etc.)
  - time_entries: rate, approved, locked
  - tasks: estimated_hours, billable, invoice_status

### Architecture Compatibility Notes
- **Current**: React + Express + Drizzle ORM
- **Specification**: Next.js + Supabase
- **Impact**: Some features require adaptation to current architecture
- **Recommendation**: Continue with current stack, implement missing features additively

### No Breaking Changes
- All test files are additive and do not modify existing functionality
- Mock implementations prevent interference with existing services
- Skipped tests clearly mark unimplemented features
- Database migrations are documented but not automatically applied

### Future Implementation Required
1. **High Priority**:
   - Password reset flow implementation
   - Altinn integration fields and UI
   - Time entry approval workflow
   - SYSTEM_OWNER role implementation

2. **Medium Priority**:
   - Comprehensive audit logging
   - "My Tasks" dashboard section
   - Weekly time view
   - RLS policy implementation

3. **Low Priority**:
   - Dev verification dashboard
   - Enhanced CI/CD pipeline
   - Performance optimizations

### Test Execution Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:all

# Run API tests only
npm run test:api

# Run E2E tests only  
npm run test:e2e

# Seed test database
npm run seed
```

**Note**: Test commands are documented but require package.json script installation through appropriate Replit tools.
