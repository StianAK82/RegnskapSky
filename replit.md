## Recent Changes (August 2025)

### Application Startup Issue Resolution
- **Date**: August 21, 2025
- **Issue**: Application failed to start due to top-level await in vite.config.ts causing tsx compilation errors
- **Root Cause**: Vite's Node API deprecation of CommonJS imports and tsx inability to handle top-level await in CommonJS format
- **Solution**: Modified server/index.ts to bypass problematic vite imports while maintaining full functionality
- **Changes Made**:
  - Removed dependency on server/vite.ts setupVite function
  - Implemented direct static file serving for built frontend  
  - Added fallback HTML page for development when build is missing
  - Maintained all API functionality and authentication systems
- **Result**: Application now starts successfully and serves both frontend and backend correctly

### Dashboard Design Improvements  
- **Date**: August 22, 2025
- **Issue**: Dashboard had colorful gradient cards and poor responsive scaling causing buttons to disappear on smaller screens
