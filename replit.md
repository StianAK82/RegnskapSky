# Zaldo CRM - Multi-Tenant Accounting Management System

## Overview

Zaldo CRM is a comprehensive Norwegian multi-tenant accounting and client management system built from scratch with strict licensing, role-based authentication, and tenant isolation. The system provides automated task generation, AML compliance tracking, time management with forced registration, comprehensive auditing, and role-specific dashboards.

### Project Completion (January 2025)
- ✅ **Complete NestJS Backend**: Modular architecture with auth, licensing, users, clients, tasks, time, AML, dashboard, notifications, audit, and flags modules
- ✅ **Prisma Database Schema**: Multi-tenant support with comprehensive entity relationships and proper indexing
- ✅ **JWT Authentication System**: 7-day tokens with MFA (TOTP), role-based guards, and tenant isolation
- ✅ **Next.js Frontend Foundation**: App Router, TypeScript, TanStack Query, shadcn/ui components

- ✅ **Tenant Isolation Guards**: All data operations require license validation, preventing cross-tenant access
- ✅ **Automated Task Generation**: Standard tasks (Bokføring, MVA, Lønn) + special deadline tasks (Aksjonærregister, Skattemelding, Årsoppgjør)
- ✅ **AML/KYC Workflow**: Status progression with 12-month renewal cycle and automated reminders
- ✅ **Time Tracking System**: Forced modal on logout, comprehensive reporting, CSV export
- ✅ **Audit Logging**: Append-only trail for all user actions across all modules
- ✅ **Feature Flags**: Per-tenant configuration management
- ✅ **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Jest unit/integration tests + Playwright E2E tests
- ✅ **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions with database migration, testing, and deployment
- ✅ **Docker Configuration**: Full containerization with PostgreSQL and Redis
